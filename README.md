# Rune-Caster Spell Tracker

A web-based spell tracking tool available at [millo5.github.io](https://millo5.github.io/).
This project was created as a personal tool to help manage an overly complicated homebrew rune-caster class in Dungeons & Dragons.

It supports not only spells and effects, but also rune components and rune architectures.

## Features

* **Spell List**
  Contains a single list of spells for quick reference, there's a neat search feature too!

* **Custom Spells**
  Add your own spells indirectly, with the worst imaginable system. As this project actually containts 2 projects;
  - The list itself
  - A backend server which if also launched the main app will connect to and allow for modifications. (which only get updated if you push again)

* **Rune Support**
  Track rune components and rune architectures for each spell.

## Project Note

This is a personal project made to support my own homebrew class in D\&D and may not follow traditional D\&D mechanics exactly.
Now this just kind of exists, its a remnant of what first was a character I played. He did manage to summon meteors on accident.
This project is discontinued, as per loss of host.
